In this High Card React App, the computer's card selection is uniquely influenced by the moon phase at the player's current location. By utilizing the Geolocation API to determine the user's position and integrating with the Open-Meteo API for real-time moon phase data, the game introduces a celestial element to randomness, appending it to natural phenomena. Each moon phase corresponds to specific card ranges and thematic statements.
